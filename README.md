### Do not leave debug statements

It's easy to leave debug statements like `dd` or `dump` in the code and push them to production.

But now we can avoid that by adding the following test.

```php
arch('Do not leave debug statements')
    ->expect(['dd', 'dump', 'var_dump'])
    ->not->toBeUsed();
```

If you are using [Ray](https://myray.app/) you should add `ray` to the expectation list as well.


### Do not use `env()` outside of config files

If we use `config:cache` in production ([which we should](https://laravel.com/docs/master/deployment#optimizing-configuration-loading)), `env()` helper will always return `null`.  
But it's very easy to forget while writing code!

Add the following test to make sure we are not doing that.

```php
arch('Do not use env helper in code')
    ->expect(['env'])
    ->not->toBeUsed();
```


### Use strict type checking

We might prefer to use [Strict type checking](https://ashallendesign.co.uk/blog/using-declare-strict_types-1-for-more-robust-php-code) in our code. 

To ensure that, we can add the following test:

```php
arch('Use string type check')
    ->expect('App')
    ->toUseStrictTypes();
```
